<h2 id="the-site">The Site</h2>

<p>The site is basically created to share my experiences, projects, publications and tech/non-tech posts. All my professional experiences and publications have been posted on the index, however, you may or may not have known me personally. The top three words that I would use to describe myself will be: enthusiastic, outgoing and hard-working.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enthusiastic: I am enthusiastic about my daily life and my research.</li>
  <li>Outgoing: I am social and can get along very well with people. I mean… Very.</li>
  <li>Hard-working: I may not be the smartest kids in the class or the lab, but I intend to be one of the most hard-working guys.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides, I travel a lot to visit those marvelous places and great people all around world. I also play tennis to relax and get away with all the work I need to do for a little while. But, hey, work’s first!</p>

<p>I am not intend to limit my scope within my research field. On the contrary, I am more than willing to know more and think more. So besides doing research of AI, I also explore real-world applications for AI and how it could be deployed. If you are also interested in this, please send me an email so that maybe we could talk more.</p>

<p>I love music (especially jazz and classical music), movies (as long as it can inspire me in some way) and traveling. And I am also very interested in (and know a lot about) American history and politics.</p>
