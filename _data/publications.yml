  desc: "Fact-based Visual Question Answering (FVQA) requires external knowledge beyond visible content to answer questions about an image. How to capture the question-oriented and information-complementary evidence remains a key challenge to solve the problem. In this paper, we depict an image by a multi-modal heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple layers of information corresponding to the visual, semantic and factual features and we proposed a modality-aware heterogeneous graph convolutional network to capture evidence from different layers that is most relevant to the given question."
